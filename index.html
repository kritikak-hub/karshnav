                <p class="description"> Karshanav Shakya is a young boy from Kathmandu, Nepal, who became the Living God Bhairav at just 3 years old. This means people believe he represents the god Bhairav, who is seen as a protector. Karshanav Shakya is a symbol of hope and spirituality for many people in Kathmandu.</p>

                <p class="description">Despite being a Living God, Karshanab leads a life like any other child. He attends school, spends time playing with his friends, and resides with his family. However, he holds a particularly unique role. He rides in a chariot with the Kumari (Living Goddess) and Ganesh (another Living God) during major celebrations like Indra Jatra. Visitors come to seek his presence, offer prayers, and receive blessings.</p>

                <p class="description">I believe in the Living God Bhairav because he is a fundamental aspect of our customs and culture. He serves as a reminder of our gods and strengthens our faith. I'm proud of Nepal's lovely custom of paying respect to Living Gods and Goddesses. They bring people together during festivals and give our culture something special.</p>
